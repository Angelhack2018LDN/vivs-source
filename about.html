          <h2>How it works</h2>
          <h3>Before a disaster</h3>

          <p>In known high risk areas, families are recorded. Data capture is done by:</p>
          <ul>

<li>photography (image recognition)</li>
<li>basic relevant data capture.</li>
<li>a secret question and answer known to the family</li>
<li>Data is written to block chain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>After a disaster</h3>

<strong>Scenario 1: a parent looking for a missing child</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Sends an SMS or MMS to Found Already looking for child.</li>
<li>Chatbot (IBM Watson) sends reply back, asking for more information if required.</li>
<li>Information is checked against database for missing children and known data of families.</li>
<li>SMS indicates parent’s location</li>
<li>Chatbot send a location (eg. refugee camp) to the parent to go to, either where the child’s likely located, or nearest NGO base where further data can be captured.</li>
          </ol>

<strong>Scenario 2: a child is found in distress</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Child is taken to a safe location (eg. refugee camp), registered and interviewed.</li>
    <li>Details are searched against the blockchain data.</li>
    <li>We then either know who their parents are, or have to find the parent.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of a natural disaster the speed of reuniting children with their families is crucial to the safety, mental and physical wellbeing of the children.</p>

          <p><strong>Found Already uses smart technology to help speed up the reunification time and ensures every child is matched with the correct guardian.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Why it’s better than what they do now...</strong></p>

<p>Example of a current solution (Save the Children in South Sudan): ‘Active tracing’ (physical on-location search for parents) was more effective than passive ‘Electronic data matching’ a factor of 12.</p>

<p>Our solution leverages this further by registering the data before a disaster happens. This data capture can be carried out in conjunction with other humanitarian projects in known risk area.
